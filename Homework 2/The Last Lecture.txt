The first few minutes of the lecture hit hard. Many are lucky not to be confronted with their own mortality until very late in life, but some are not so lucky. There is a distinct desire that seems built into each of us -- to leave our mark on the world. What knowledge would you feel important to impart upon the people around you if you suddenly found out your time left was limited? Rausch takes the opportunity to encourage us within his "last lecture" to pursue the seemingly wild dreams that bubble up within us as children. These dreams, often grandiose and ridiculous in scope, are easy to write off as things unachievable. However, should one never try, or take the leap, one will never see how far they could have gotten. Pursuing a career as an artist has been my dream ever since I could pick up a pencil. I have heard discouraging things about it my entire life, which has made taking the leap not very easy, but I am certain that, even if nothing works out, I will rest assured knowing I tried to achieve that dream -- I will never have to wonder about what could have been.
