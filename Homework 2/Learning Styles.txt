My personal learning style leans heavily into the visual/tactical categories. I learn best when shown visual representations and with hands-on experience as opposed to reading or listening to instructions. When I play card games, I never understand the rules fully before I play it, in spite of the person reading the rules' best efforts. In a team setting, designating learning styles is an incredibly helpful way to reach a compromise with workflow. It is always in my best interest to meet people where they're at, and knowing how best they receive instructions is the first step.
