From what I can gather, the Command Line Interface is a solely text-based platform where code is put, whereas the Graphical User Interface such as GitHub Desktop is a collection of additional buttons and shortcuts that can help you code. Starting with the GUI seems more accessible to those who have never coded before, while the CLI is completely customizable because you can build your code from the ground up. Github's GUI offers an easy way to organize your files and makes easy pathways for operations like pushing and cloning.
